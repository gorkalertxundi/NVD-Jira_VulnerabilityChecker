# NVD-Jira Vulnerability Management Script
This script is designed to search for vulnerabilities on the NVD API for a given list of CPE items, and create a new issue in Jira if any are found. It also checks if there is already a Jira issue created with the same CVE ID to avoid duplicated Jira issues.

## Prerequisites
- A Jira instance with API access and an existing project to create the issues in.
- Jira API auth credentials (username and password)
- A list of CPE items to search for vulnerabilities
## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Replace the following variables in the script with the relevant information for your Jira instance and CPE list:
    - jira_url: Jira API endpoint
    - jira_username: Jira API auth username
    - jira_password: Jira API auth password
    - cpe_list: List of CPE items to search for vulnerabilities
    - project_key: Jira project key where you want to create the issues
3. Run the script using Python.
## Output
The script will output the HTTP status code of the Jira issue creation request. If an issue with the same CVE ID already exists, it will output a message indicating that the issue already exists. If no vulnerabilities are found for a CPE item, it will output a message indicating that no vulnerabilities were found.

Please note that the script is for demonstration purposes only and should be modified to fit the specific requirements of your use case.

## Additional notes
- This script uses the NVD API to search for vulnerabilities. You can adjust the NVD API endpoint and parameters to fit your needs.
- This script uses the Jira API to create issues. You can adjust the Jira API endpoint, parameters and fields to fit your needs.
- As the script uses the Jira API to search for existing issues and custom fields, you should check if the custom fields ids are the same in your jira instance or replace them with the appropriate ones.
